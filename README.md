# Advanced Customer Relationship Management API Documentation

### Overview

This project involves developing an advanced client relationship management (CRM) software. The CRM is written in Go and provides efficient management of customer relationships.

### Codebase

The project is structured with a modular approach. Code modules are mainly divided into three parts: User Interface, Services, and Data Access.
- User Interface: Handles all user interactions with the software.
- Services: Contains logic and operations including customer management.
- Data Access: Implements connectivity with database and defines CRUD operations.

A significant part of this project is assisting customers, which is implemented by functions like assignLead and parseTimePeriod.

### Notable Functions
Here are some relevant functions in this project:
- assignLead: This function is used when a lead is to be assigned to a brand ambassador or some other role for further follow-up.
- parseTimePeriod: This function is used to parse time period strings, e.g., "HH:MM-HH:MM", into corresponding time.Time values. The input string should be in the format "HH:MM-HH:MM".
